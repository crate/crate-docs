Conventions
===========

Consistency makes collaboration easier. To that end, please try to
follow the applicable conventions.

We have two core principals:

.. rst-class:: open

1. Don't follow a convention if it means introducing local
   inconsistencies. Consistency within a project is important. Consistency
   within a file is more important. Consistency within a logical subsection
   of a file is the most important.

2. Know when to be inconsistent. Break any of these conventions sooner
   than doing anything foolish.

.. NOTE::

    Please help us to develop this section of the handbook! At the
    moment, we only have guides for the documentation. But we could
    probably do with guides for software development, infrastructure,
    and so on.
