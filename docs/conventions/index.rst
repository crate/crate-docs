Conventions
===========

Consistency makes collaboration easier. To that end, please try to follow the
applicable conventions.

We have two core principles:

.. rst-class:: open

1. Don't follow a convention if it means introducing local inconsistencies.
   Consistency within a project is important. Consistency within a file is more
   important. Consistency within a logical subsection of a file is the most
   important.

2. Know when to be inconsistent. Break any of these conventions sooner than
   doing anything foolish.

.. NOTE::

    Please help us to develop this section of the handbook! At the moment, we
    only have guides for the documentation. But we could probably do with
    guides for software development, infrastructure, and so on.
