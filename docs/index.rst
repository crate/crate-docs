======================
Doing Docs at Crate.io
======================

The `Crate.io Docs`_ project contains the :ref:`common build system
<common-build>`, :ref:`QA tools <qa>`, :ref:`style guides <style>`, and other
meta miscellanies for doing docs at `Crate.io`_.

.. NOTE::

    We have designed this project so that it also function as a reference
    implementation for you to use when :ref:`creating new Sphinx projects
    <sphinx>`, :ref:`setting up GitHub repositories <github>`, :ref:`working
    with the common build system <common-build>`, and so on.

.. NOTE::

    This Sphinx project uses the standard `Crate Docs Theme`_ to for
    demonstration purposes, despite not being intended for inclusion in the
    `main documentation`_ navigation tree on the live Crate.io website.

    When viewing these docs, a *Doing Docs at Crate.io* navigation heading is
    shown towards the bottom navigation tree (on the left-hand side of the
    screen). However, under normal circumstances,
    this navigation heading is hidden.

    Read more about :ref:`how the theme works <theme>`.
