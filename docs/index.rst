Crate Docs Build
================

This repository currently contains support for the Crate docs build system,
used for testing the validity and correctness of documentation. We are
currently migrating other docs-related materials that should be public to it,
so it can serve in the near future as the base for all materials concerning the
docs. Since our documentation is open source, we want to enable external
contributors by making supporting materials (such as our conventions and style
guide) publicly available.
