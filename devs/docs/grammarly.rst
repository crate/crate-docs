=========

`Grammarly`_ is a tool for automatically proofreading text. Automatic
proofreading helps catch things an editor may have missed. Crate.io
has a business account available for staff.

Suggested use:

- When writing new content, run the copy through Grammarly as a final step (and
  make the necessary changes) before requesting a review.

- When providing editorial support (for example, reviewing GitHub pull
  requests), use Grammarly to assist you.

Suggested workflow:

- Open the `web app`_
- Select *New*
- Copy and paste the text you are working on into the new Grammarly document
- Work through the suggestions
- As you go, copy the changes back to your source material

Admittedly, this isn't the smoothest experience. (However, the value of
automatic proofreading usually makes it worth it.) If you have alternative
suggestions, please add them.

Note: It's up to you what you do with the Grammarly document after you're
done. You may wish to delete it to keep your Grammarly dashboard clean. Or you
may wish to abandon the documents and ignore the increasingly cluttered
dashboard.

**NOTE**
  Grammarly business accounts allow you to `share a style guide`_. At the
  moment, we are only using this to correct Crate-specific proper nouns.

**SEE ALSO**
  The `common build system`_ uses a very simple `Vale`_ configuration for
  automated prose linting. This functionality may be expanded in the future.
