# Preview an RST file
# =============================================================================

# This script can be used to generate an HTML preview of any RST file you may
# be editing.
#
# Usage:
#
#    preview-rst <RST_FILE>
#
# This script is not intended to be run by hand. It has been written with the
# purpose of being integrated into a desktop editing environment. Integration
# is possible if you are using an editor that allows you to extend its
# functionality with arbitrary scripting.
#
# In particular, you may get the most use out of this script if you bind it to
# a keyboard shortcut like <Command-P> (for "preview"). This would likely
# involve overriding the "Print" keyboard shortcut of your editor, which,
# depending on your situation, may not be too important.
#
# This script has two modalities:
#
# - Running this script on RST files in a Sphinx project should open a new
#   browser window to the corresponding HTML page.
#
#   If you are editing lots of files, this can save a significant amount of
#   time because it does not require you to navigate to each page manually to
#   check your work.
#
# - Running this script on a standalone file (e.g., `CHANGES.rst`) will build
#   an HTML version and open a new browser window to display it.
#
#   This is helpful because without pushing a file to GitHub (or elsewhere)
#   there is no easy way to preview your work. Indeed, lots of errors may creep
#   in because of this limitation.
#
# For standalone files, there are two strategies currently implemented:
#
# - The basic strategy (`display_standalone`) uses pandoc to generate a simple
#   HTML file. This file has no styling whatsoever and, as a result, the result
#   may be hard to read. This strategy has been disabled in favor of the Sphinx
#   strategy (see next item).
#
# - The Sphinx strategy (`display_standalone_sphinx`) creates a temporary
#   Sphinx project for your RST file, starts `sphinx-autobuild`, and opens a
#   new browser window.
#
#   This strategy has many advantages:
#
#   - At the moment, the Read The Docs theme is used. This styles your RST in
#     an easy-to-ready manner.
#
#   - The `sphinx-autobuild` program features live reloading, meaning that when
#     you edit the RST file, the HTML will be rebuilt, and the browser window
#     will automatically refresh to show your changes.


# Caution
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This script is a work in progress and features may be added, removed, or
# changed significantly.
#
# TODO:
#
# - Assorted `TODO` markers scattered throughout the code
#
# - Add wrappers for specific editors (e.g., BBEdit)
#
# - Needs to exclude some directives (e.g., admonitions) when generating
#   standalone files to mimic GitHub's limited RST support


# Setup
