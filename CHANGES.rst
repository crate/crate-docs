==========

- We are transitioning to Sphinx 3.x., so the specific requirement
  to use Sphinx 1.7.4 has been relaxed to allow all of Sphinx <4.

- Use ``.venv`` as a directory under ``.crate-docs`` for
  hosting the built-in virtualenv. This prevents many
  search tools crossing that boundary.

- Relax Makefile constraint to specifically use Python 3.7.
  Now, any version of Python >= 3.7 is allowed.

- Disable `proselint.Annotations` so that using `**NOTE**` in standalone RST
  files does not raise an error.

- Pass target (`html` or `linkcheck`) through to `sphinx-build` (fixes
  https://github.com/crate/crate-docs/issues/30)

- The `qa` target now generates full git log CSV files for each RST file,
  including commit subject. Subject lines can be scanned for keywords (by future
  QA tooling) to help classify commits.

  In the future, additional QA tools can be developed to generate additional
  CSV files. For example, to record information reported by Vale.

  The filename stem used by each CSV file can be used to determine the relevant
  source RST file.


0.4.0 - 2020/09/29
==================

- Add the `qa` target which generates QA telemetry in the form of CSV files for
  post-processing. At the moment, the only information reported is the modified
  date (as reported by Git) and the reviewed date (as manually recorded using
  RST metadata).
- Modified the `lint` target to also produce CSV files for post-processing.
