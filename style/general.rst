===================
General Conventions
===================

Consistency makes collaboration easier. To that end, please try to follow the
applicable general conventions.

We have two core principles:

1. Don't follow a convention if it means introducing local inconsistencies.
   Consistency within a project is important. Consistency within a file is more
   important. Consistency within a logical subsection of a file is the most
   important.

2. Know when to be inconsistent. Break any of these conventions sooner than
   doing anything foolish.
