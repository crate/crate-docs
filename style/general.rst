===================
General Conventions
===================

Approach
========

`Diátaxis`_ is a systematic approach to technical documentation authoring.

Following its paradigms,
there are four main types of documentation:
tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference, and explanation.

- A tutorial is a practical activity, in which the student learns by doing
  something meaningful, towards some achievable goal.

- A how-to guide helps the user get something done, correctly and safely;
  it guides the user’s action.

- Reference material contains propositional or theoretical knowledge that
  a user looks to in their work.

- Explanations deepen and broaden the reader’s understanding of a subject.
  They bring clarity, light and context.

.. note::

    **CrateDB documentation loosely follows Diátaxis paradigms.** There is no
    need to adhere to them too strictly across the board when it is not
    applicable, or would need too many efforts to refactor or improve
    existing material.

    It is always good to pursue noble goals, but the focus will be on
    working software.

Consistency
===========

Consistency makes collaboration easier. To that end, please try to follow the
applicable general conventions.

We have two core principles:

1. Don't follow a convention if it means introducing local inconsistencies.
   Consistency within a project is important. Consistency within a file is more
   important. Consistency within a logical subsection of a file is the most
   important.

2. Know when to be inconsistent. Break any of these conventions sooner than
   doing anything foolish.
