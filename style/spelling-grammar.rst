Spelling and Grammar
====================

Some basic principles:

- US English instead of British English

  - Examples:
  
    - Write "catalog" (US English). Avoid "catalogue" (British English).

    - Write "license" (US English). Avoid "Licence" (British English).

- Compound adjectives should be hypenated whereas compound nouns should not be hypenated

  - Examples:

    - Write "time-series" as an adjective and "time series" as a noun.
    
    - Write "real-time" as an adjective (e.g., "real-time analytics") and "real time" as a noun phrase (e.g., "can be queried in real time").

    - Write "open-source" as an adjective and "open source" as a noun.

    - Write "purpose-built" (adjective). Avoid "purpose built".

    - Write "large-scale" (adjective). Avoid "large scale" and "largescale".

    - Write "use case" (noun). Avoid "use-case".

    - Write "shared-nothing" (adjective). Avoid "share-nothing".

    - Write "machine data" (noun). Avoid "machine-data" and "machinedata".

    - Write "data center" (noun). Avoid "data-center" and any variation using "centre" (British English).

  - Exceptions to the rule:
  
    - Write "ad hoc" instead of "ad-hoc". (Citation: `StackExchange <https://english.stackexchange.com/a/157332>`_.)

- Drop the hypen from compound words when it is common practice to do so.

  - Examples:

    - Write "database". Avoid "data-base" and "data base".
    
    - Write "startup". Avoid "start-up" and "start up".

Specific guidelines:

- Write "Crate.io" when refering to the company. Avoid "Crate", "Crate.IO", and other variants.

- Write "an SQL" (using "SQL" as an initialism pronounced "S Q L") instead of "a SQL" (using "SQL" an acronym pronounced "sequel"). (Citation: `StackExchange <https://english.stackexchange.com/a/5266>`_)
  
- Treat "IoT" as a proper noun (e.g., do not preface "IoT" with "the"). Treat "Internet of Things" as a collective noun (e.g., "the Internet of Things" is considered good style).
